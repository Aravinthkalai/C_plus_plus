C++

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

main()
{
cout<<"Hello world";
}


cout -> object
<<->insertion operator

namespace 
--------
if we write a ,multiple line of codes the part of of code is splitted and named it, thats  called namespace 

same namespace group content we can access without proiding the name , bit if we want to access from outside group we need to 
mention the name  

namespace std ; has a definition about "cout" that why we writting namespace here , and cout is called as object and it's from
namespace std class



scope resolution operator
