/*Inline fucntion 
* An inline function is a function where the compiler attempts to
replace the function call with the actual code of the function to 
reduce the overhead of a function call.
* The inline keyword is a request, not a command. The compiler may or 
  may not inline the function.
* It uses cache to save jumping between memory (stack size will reduce)
* If the function is called 1000 times, the code appears 1000 times â†’ increased binary (executable) size.
* Use it if the function has two lines and called very rare condition
